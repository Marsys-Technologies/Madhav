-- 757_nirmana_l1_ga_structural_integrity_contract_parivartana.sql
--
-- NIRMĀṆA L1 Gaṇita — W3 IMPLEMENT. Third follow-up F-A14 widening pass for ga_structural.
-- Migration 745 covered graha_vargottama_amplification_factor; migration 755 added bhadra_flag/
-- panchaka_flag; migration 756 added vargottama_per_varga (4/57). This adds
-- parivartana_per_varga, taking coverage to 5/57.
--
-- Investigated graha_dignity_per_varga first (a natural next "per_varga" target given
-- vargottama's cross-check pattern) but found the disagreement rate against ga_vargas' own
-- varga_dignity (2064/3915 rows) is a VOCABULARY GRANULARITY mismatch, not a computation defect:
-- ga_structural's classify_dignity() uses a 5-way scheme (exalted/debilitated/own/moolatrikona/
-- neutral) while ga_vargas' _compute_dignity() uses 7-way (adds friend/enemy) -- comparing them
-- directly would flag thousands of legitimate friend/enemy-collapsed-to-neutral classifications
-- as false violations. Not pursued as a conjunct; parivartana_per_varga chosen instead.
--
-- parivartana_per_varga is the KNOWN, ALREADY-FIXED-AT-THE-WRITER-LEVEL F-157 finding
-- (test_f157_parivartana_self_exchange.py): the writer used to fabricate self-paired "exchange"
-- rows (e.g. fact_subject='D1_JUPITER_JUPITER', a graha "exchanging" with itself) for any graha
-- sitting in its own sign, since lord1==g1 made the OWN_SIGNS test trivially true against itself.
-- The writer fix (a `lord1 != g1` guard) already landed, but per that fix's own documented
-- "Materialization note": the buggy rows already stored in chart_facts were NOT retroactively
-- corrected -- that requires a separately-authored ga_structural rebuild for affected charts,
-- not executed by that PR. Confirmed live: 439/624 rows are STILL self-paired
-- (planet_a == planet_b) across all 3 built charts and all 5 ayanamshas per chart, all under a
-- single build_id each (not a stale-build artifact -- this is the one canonical build for every
-- affected chart, simply not yet rebuilt since the writer fix landed).
--
-- Two conjuncts:
--   (f) planet_a != planet_b -- re-derives the F-157 writer guard as a data check. GENUINELY RED
--       TODAY on 439/624 rows -- tracked, expected, will clear once the affected charts next
--       rebuild (same disposition as migration 745's conjunct (b) for F-A15, migration 756's
--       conjunct (e) for F-A17).
--   (g) for the genuinely non-self-paired rows, the classical parivartana condition itself:
--       sign_a's lord == planet_b AND sign_b's lord == planet_a (SIGN_LORDS, the same table the
--       writer itself uses) -- re-derived directly from the stored sign_a/sign_b/planet_a/
--       planet_b values, not restated. 0/185 violations live (both directions independently
--       verified before combining).
--
-- integrity_check_sql is a single UPDATE ... SET column, not additive SQL -- this migration
-- carries migrations 745's/755's/756's five original conjuncts (a) through (e) forward VERBATIM,
-- including conjuncts (b) and (e), which remain GENUINELY RED TODAY exactly as migration 756
-- already documented (F-A15/F-A17 fixes landed, tracked charts not yet rebuilt). Because (b),
-- (e), and the new (f) are all red, the combined 7-conjunct SELECT evaluates to false on live
-- production today; conjuncts (f)/(g) were verified INDIVIDUALLY (their own NOT EXISTS subquery
-- in isolation) rather than via the full combined SELECT.
--
-- Every conjunct was EXECUTED against live production and MUTATION-PROVED before landing.
--
-- Transaction ownership belongs to platform/scripts/migrate.ts.
