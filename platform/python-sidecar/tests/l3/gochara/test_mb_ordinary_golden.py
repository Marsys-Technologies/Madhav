"""Codex round 3 (steward MB-CODEX-3): an ORDINARY (markerless) build is observably identical to MAIN's, proven against a golden GENERATED FROM THE UNMODIFIED MAIN TREE.

The golden (`fixtures/mb_ordinary_golden_main.json`) was produced by running THIS file's capture, byte for byte the same code, on commit 75eeda4c9 (main when the
measuring build merged it; its `services/` and `pipeline/` differ from this branch only in the measuring build's own files):

    MB_GOLDEN_OUT=<path> python -m pytest tests/l3/gochara/test_mb_ordinary_golden.py -k capture

It holds, for a markerless run driven through the writer's REAL substeps on the real migration chain (the a55 template), with the real runner's config keys
(`chart_id`, `birth_params`) and an explicit rehearsal horizon:
  * every substep kind (rules, convention, body, manifest, snapshot, inventory, coverage, record, window, verify) and a dry run: its observable outcome (rows inserted
    and notes, or the refusal's type and message), the SQL statements it issued through the connection (whitespace-normalised text and parameter count, kept as a count
    per distinct statement shape plus the sha256 of the ordered sequence), and the row count of every ka_gochara_* / kala_gochara_* table after it;
  * the candidate manifest's input vector, every component.
HEAD must equal it except (a) `implementation.*` (the code changed; the digests MUST move, and exactly the two stages that gained a module do) and (b) ONE extra
read-only statement per non-dry-run substep: the state guard's `SELECT state FROM public.asset_throughput ...` (a deliberate change to every v5 build).
Texts are normalised only for values that differ between two runs of the SAME tree (per-world ids and the digests derived from them, in the notes): hex runs of 12+
characters (or a truncated id before an ellipsis) and UUIDs. Two captures on main agree exactly after that."""
