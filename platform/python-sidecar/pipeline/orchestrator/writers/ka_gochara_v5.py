"""ka_gochara_v5 — Pravāha A5.3: the '5.0' gochara writer.

PHASE 1 (geometry_store) LANDED: substeps `convention` → `body:<Body>` ×8
build the §6.1 sky-event substrate (boundary events per body over the pinned
convention domain, stations always swiss_refined) via
services/gochara_kernel/substrate.py, under the implementation pins
(steward 2026-10-01, M20261001T015412-6df0; brief
A5_3_REGISTERED_WRITER_BRIEF_v1_0.md). Moon is excluded from the materialised
substrate (pin 6: EPHEMERAL, moon_on_demand).

STEP rule_binding LANDED: the `rules` substep (FIRST in the plan) binds
Stream B's P1–P5 rule catalogue (rule_version 1.0.0) into migration 1154's
registry tables — predicates, factors, paths, composite membership, F3 seals
— via services/gochara_kernel/rule_registry.py, under the Gochara-5 GLOBAL
family key with NO chart lock in this substep (N13 mutual exclusion). P6 and
sad_bala_summary are deferred (rule_registry.py D1/D2). Later steps
(window_evaluator, interval_sweep, day_on_demand) extend this plan; the spec
text folds the pins into v1.5 at the A5.5 Codex gate.

Discipline (unchanged from the skeleton):
  * @register('ka_gochara_v5') on a WriterBase subclass, asset_id pinned.
  * Chart-scope refusal: any chart_id ≠ PINNED_CHART_ID raises ChartRefusal
    BEFORE any planning or execution (fail-closed; never a silent no-op).
  * Every write rides ctx.db_conn — never committed, rolled back or closed
    here; no other connection is ever opened.
  * The chart family key (ka_gochara_lock_chart) is taken before any
    substrate write (steward ruling B / N13 substrate order).
  * Candidate-only: nothing here publishes, seals or flips a generation.
  * Registry row: asset_registry_seed.ts with is_active=false (inert to
    runPreparation's planning set and recalibrationEnqueue's writer sweep) —
    same mechanism as PR #2799, no migration. Pins admission (digests /
    analysis-layer pins / capability census) is a separate governed step and
    is deliberately NOT part of this change.

FROZEN ORCHESTRATOR CONTRACT (§N.2)
------------------------------------
  * @register('ka_gochara_v5') on a WriterBase subclass
  * SUBSTEP shape: plan_substeps(ctx) static (convention → body ×8);
    run_substep(ctx, step) per pin-5 grain; run(ctx) inherited (aggregates)
  * ctx.db_conn — writes only inside the orchestrator's transaction
  * never writes asset_throughput
