# SAMPŪRTI CAMPAIGN LEDGER

CONDUCTOR-HEARTBEAT: 2026-08-10T05:00+05:30 (SAMPURTI-CONDUCTOR-2026-08-10) [context-resume after compaction]

## WAVE POSITION

WAVE 0 — IGNITION. Status: 3 lanes MERGED to integration (L0b/L0c/L0d);
3 lanes still building (L0a/L0e/L0f). All verdicts recorded before merge.
Waves 1–4: NOT-STARTED.

## RAILS (immutable, restated for every reader)

R13 no-fitting · R19 L1 sealed · R14 measurement versioning (never overwrite) ·
sweep corpus untouchable (report 606/606 + 16,297/19,323 detector-cited after
each rebuild) · R18 bounded scoring · blind-before-effect (definition committed
before effects computed; CI-checkable by commit order) · R16 every claim
scope-stated + detector-cited · R29 full delegation to NATIVE-PRATINIDHI except
life-event data creation (Abhinandan LEL AWAITING-NATIVE; genuinely ambiguous
LEL resolver rows PARKED-honest, never guessed).

ONE gate packet at wave end → main + deploy (content fixes must be deployed
before Wave 1's rebuild).

## WAVE 1 · S1 — PA-0 STAGE I/O MAP (COMPLETE, read-only, conductor, 2026-08-10 03:55 IST)

All detectors cited inline. Code refs are sampurti/integration @ 1069fff77;
live queries ran against production via cloud-sql-proxy:5433.

**Writer wiring mechanism (the S2 target):** `services/ka_kshetra/writer.py`
`plan_substeps` probes the four stage modules for a module-level
`plan_substeps` attribute (writer.py:309–314) and routes foreign substeps via
module-level `handles_substep`/`run_substep` (writer.py:360–370). None of
stage0–3 exposes `plan_substeps` (writer.py:245 says so in prose; grep
confirms zero `def plan_substeps` in stage0/1/2/3 files) → RC1 confirmed at
code level. Plugin-lane substeps are included BEFORE stage4 substeps
(writer.py:243–245). §N.3 idempotency delete runs ONCE in plan_substeps on
the fresh/replanned branch, NEVER per-substep (writer.py module docstring
:20–:23 — the ka_gochara_sweep blood lesson); each stage's own
REPLACE_PRIOR_SQL must therefore move under that same discipline when wired.

**Per-stage I/O (grep detectors, line-cited):**
| Stage | READS | WRITES |
|---|---|---|
| stage0_kinematics | ephemeris_daily (:635) · chart_facts (:677, :686) · bg_transit_rules (:712) | kala_field_kinematics — delete-then-insert (:762, :765) |
| stage1_symbolization | kala_field_kinematics (:185, :198, :215) · kala_field_boundaries (:314–331; hard-requires live conn) | kala_field_primitives (envelope JSONB knots — the "envelopes" store; there is no separate envelopes table) — delete-then-insert (:368, :371) |
| stage2_promise | bodha_cgm_nodes (:327) · bodha_cgm_edges (:338) · bodha_pratijna (:360) · bodha_msr_signals (:397) | kala_field_promise_nodes (:546) · kala_field_promise_edges (:558) · kala_field_routes (:571) — triple delete (:583–585) |
| stage3_clocks | chart_dashas (:400, :414, :428, :509, :518, :1014, :1127) · kala_field_promise_routes (:1163 — S1-F1 DEFECT below) · own outputs re-read (:1096, :1116, :1186) | kala_field_clocks (:842, :848) · kala_field_boundaries (:1068, :1074) — delete-then-insert per system |

**Derived wiring order for S2:** stage0 → stage2 → stage3 → stage1 → existing
stage4+. Rationale: stage1 reads BOTH stage0's kinematics and stage3's
boundaries (the PA-0 probe finding, now line-cited); stage3 reads stage2's
route gains. Cross-check before build: stage4 already reads routes/clocks/
boundaries/kinematics (stage4_field.py:802, :832, :864, :930) and primitives
(per stage1 module docstring: "stage 4 can consume every" envelope), so all
four stage lanes belong before every stage4 substep — exactly where the
writer's plugin mechanism already puts them.

**S1-F1 DEFECT (live-verified):** `kala_field_promise_routes` is defined in
NO migration (repo-wide SQL grep: zero matches) and does NOT exist in
production (detector: pg_class relname LIKE 'kala_field%' query, 03:55 IST —
absent from list). Yet stage3_clocks.py:1163 SELECTs route_gain,
suppressed_by from it. `kala_field_routes` DOES carry exactly route_gain +
suppressed_by (information_schema query, 03:58 IST) → high-confidence naming
defect; S2's stage3 lane must repoint to kala_field_routes (verify semantics
at build time), else stage3 crashes on first real run.

**PA-0 audit answer (live-verified, 03:55 IST, chart 482012f1):**
kinematics=0 · primitives=0 · routes=0 · clocks=0 · boundaries=0. ALL of
stages 0–3 share the never-run fate — the wiring gap is the single root
cause for all five empty lead tables. (kala_field_promise_nodes/edges also
written only by stage2, so presumed 0 as well — S2 builder to confirm.)

## G9 DISPUTES QUEUE (for Wave 3 mini-cycles)

(empty — L0e populates)

## L0f PARKED-AMBIGUOUS LEL ROWS (await native's memory — never guessed)

R15 shadow row (to be ledgered after PARĪKṢAKA pass): event_id contains 'fs' suffix, NULL domain,
candidates=[relocation, foreign_settlement]. Primary row (no 'fs' suffix) correctly resolves via
tier-1 to `foreign_settlement`. This row is PARKED-honest pending native memory confirmation.

## DECISIONS LOG (PRATINIDHI rulings with written rationale)

**D-1 (L0d PRATINIDHI, 04:10 IST 2026-08-10):** G13/PA-4 fix operationally complete.
CANONICAL_DOMAINS resolves to 13 entries live; all 3 writers instantiate cleanly;
live DB shows 6 domains pre-rebuild (confirming the gap); 15 unit tests pass; census
gate blocks regression. A Wave-1 full-DAG rebuild will produce 13-domain CDLM coverage.
VERDICT: APPROVED.

## GATE LOG (integration → main packets, deploy evidence, production==main)

(none yet — pending Wave 0 completion of L0a/L0e/L0f)

## DEBTS / PARKS (cause VERIFIED live or it is a defect)

**DEBT-1 (L0b policy violation, recorded 04:10 IST 2026-08-10):** L0b builder applied
migration 553 directly to production BEFORE PARĪKṢAKA review, violating
PRODUCTION_GATE_EXECUTION_POLICY v1.1 §1 ("The builder swarm NEVER executes the
gated action itself"). PARĪKṢAKA assessed NON-BLOCKING: migration is a single-row
metadata upsert (asset_throughput sentinel, state='lit', rows_written=0, chart_id
IS NULL), fully reversible with one-line DELETE, no data destroyed. Production state
is now consistent with PR intent. Precedent: even benign migrations must go through
the gate. Builder swarm instructed to never self-apply migrations in future lanes.

## NEXT-ACTION

Context-resumed 05:00. Dispatched PARĪKṢAKA for L0a/L0e/L0f and PRATINIDHI for L0a/L0e.
On PASS verdicts: record in ledger, merge in order: L0f (#1135 mig-554) → L0e (#1136 mig-555) → L0a (#1137 no-mig).
Then ONE Wave-0 gate packet → GATE-EXECUTOR → integration→main + deploy + production==main.
S1 complete; S2 dispatch after gate. Content fixes must deploy before Wave-1 rebuild.

If this conductor dies: resume per prompt — adopt live lanes, salvage dead worktrees
(commit+push, never delete), never re-dispatch merged work. Merged lanes: L0b, L0c, L0d.
